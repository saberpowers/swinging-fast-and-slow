Description: In May 2024, MLB released exciting new swing tracking data. Bat speed and swing length
  are recorded at contact (or at the point in the swing path closest to contacting the ball).
  Because the batter's timing affects where the measurement occurs along the swing path, care must
  be taken to avoid erroneous conclusions from the data. In this package, we estimate
  player-specific intended swing location based on count and pitch location, and we analyze the
  effect of approach on swing outcomes.
