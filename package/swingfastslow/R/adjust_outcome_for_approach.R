#' Adjust pitch outcome predictions for batter approach
#' 
#' This function takes a table of n pitches (expressed as outcome predictions for `prob_contact`,
#' `prob_fair` and `pred_hit`) and a table of m approaches (expressed as `strikes_bat_speed` and
#' `strikes_swing_length`) and returns a table of n * m predictions, one prediction for each pitch
#' for each approach.
#' 
#' @param pred_outcome_pitch a table with columns `prob_contact`, `prob_fair` and `pred_hit`
#' @param approach a table with columns `strikes_bat_speed` and `strikes_swing_length`
#' @param approach_model a list of fitted GLM models from \code{\link{fit_approach_model}}
#' 
#' @returns a table with approach-adjusted `prob_contact`, `prob_fair` and `pred_hit`
